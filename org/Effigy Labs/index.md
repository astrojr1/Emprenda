Effigy Labs is a startup development and manufacturing company.  We will be manufacturing a line of products, including and to begin with, a musical pedal that is MIDI and USB capable.  This pedal uses our proprietary human interface technology, but the circuit board and software are open source.  Our hardware and software source are published here on github.  Effigy Labs embraces the open source and community-based paradigms of product management, in order to improve our products and to encourage as much innovation from as many talented individuals as possible.
